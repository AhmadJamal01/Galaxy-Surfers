## How to Run 🚀
First ensure having Cmake and build the project using
```
cmake --build ./build 
```
then follow up with
```
./bin/GAME_APPLICATION -c='config/app_ship.jsonc'
```

## Lore 📖
You wake up in a spaceship lost in a universe and your goal is escape the dense asteroid belt (survive with the highest score possible) to continue the mission of finding Earth v2.0. 

## Controls 🎮 
❇️ Press A or D to make the ship navigate to the left or right respectively.

❇️ Gravity due to Earth v2.0 naturally moves the spaceship forward but the spaceship can be accelrated by pressing W (spaceship accelerator) to make the score increase much faster (while running the risk of hitting an asteroid).

❇️ Hitting a monkey grants a score boost and energy from the 79th element that allows the spaceship to fly over the asteroid belt for a limited period of time.

❇️ Play with your friends and see who can get the highest score!
